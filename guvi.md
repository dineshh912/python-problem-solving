# How to calculate running time of an algorithm>

There are two ways to calculate running time experimental methods and analytical method.

Experimental method:
	We implement algorithm on specific language and run it with diffrent input and record running time of algorithm.

There are two challenges with this method, 1. software & hardware running the program. so it's depend method. some time result might not we expected.

Analytical method:
	It's a theroratical approach, we analyze running time based on input.

Worst case analysis:
	To understand how an algorithm can perfrom on different size of input we need to analyze algorithm on different cases.

it's is a case when an algorithm will take a maximum running time for input size n to execute. 

let's say if we are searching an element in an array using a searching algorithm then if an element is found at the last index then it's a worst-case for the algorithm. so generally we consider an input for which the algorithm takes the longest time to execute.

The worst case is very informative and is usually done because an algorithm can't execute in a time that is greater than the worst case.

Best case analysis:
	Algorithm take minimum running time for an input size. 
this case is not very informative because it's doesn't show the real execution time of an algorithm.

generally it's very difficult to compute the average case. because the input size is very. 

Big O notation: Tool to compare efficinency of algorithm. It represents upper bound of an algorithm.

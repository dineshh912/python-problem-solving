# Python

* Difference between list and tuples

  * List can be editable, tuples can't

  * List are slower than tuples

  * Tuples operation have smaller size than list, so it's faster. a.__sizeof()

  * [], ()

  * List has variable lenght, tuple has fixed length.

  * Adding trail comma creates a tuple

* Key features

  * It's interpreted language.

  * Dynamically typed, need not to mention the type of the variable.

  * It's OOPS, but doesn't have access specifiers (private, public)

* PEP8 - Python enhancement proposal

* Memory management in python is managed by private heap space. memory manager.

* namespace - system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.

* os, sys, math, random, datetime, time, json

* Case sensitive

* Array can hold single data type, list can store multiple data type.

* __init__ is a method or constructor in Python. This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/ instance of a class is created. All classes have the __init__ method.

* [::-1] - reverse the order of list or array

* from random import shuffle -  to randamize object

* Iterators are objests which can be traversed through or iterated upon

* Random module is the standared module that is used to generate a random number.
  * randrange(a,b) - It choose the integer define between a, b.

  * uniform(a,b) - It choose a floating point number.

  * normalvariate(mean, sdev) - normal distrubution

* Difference range & Xrange
  * Both will return a list of integers, only difference is range returns list, xrange returns xrange object. generators

* Function that returns an iterable set of items are called generators.

* capitalize()

* str.lower(), str.upper()

* is, not, in

  * is return when two operands are true.

  * not - return the inverse of the boolean value

  * in - checks if some elements in some sequence

* It defines one-one relationship between keys and values.

* Split() - Split the sentence based on given string list

* Sub() - FInd the sub string and replace it

* subn() - similar to sub and also returns the new string along with no of replacements

* os.remove() - Delete python files

* Python nested list won't support vectorzied operation like element wise addition, multiplication.

* append(), extend(), insert()

* pop(), remove()

* s

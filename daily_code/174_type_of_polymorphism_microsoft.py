"""

Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism

* Ad-hoc Polymorphism
* Parametric Polymorphism
* Subtype Polymorphism 

Ad-hoc Polymorphism:

    We can implement overload function based on different types.
    EX: + behaves differently based on data type. (integer, float, list, string concat)

Parametric Polymorphism:

    Generic implementation independent of types. 

    ex: Append 

Subtype Polymorphism:

    When we subclass a class and use each subclass method to implement a specific interface.

    Class shape:
        def draw()

    class circle(shape)
        def draw()
